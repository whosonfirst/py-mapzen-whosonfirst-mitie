# py-mapzen-whosonfirst-mitie

Tools and libraries for working with Who's On First data and the MITIE tool-chain

## IMPORTANT

This library is provided as-is, right now. It lacks proper
documentation which will probably make it hard for you to use unless
you are willing to poke and around and investigate things on your
own.
